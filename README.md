# fabric-data-concierge
Building an enterprise-grade Fabric data Agent episodically.

## Pitch

Fabric Data Concierge is a governed, self-service analytics agent for Microsoft Fabric. It lets employees discover approved datasets, ask questions in natural language, and get accurate, auditable answers while enforcing Purview sensitivity labels and  existing RLS/CLS policies by design. When access is missing, it automatically opens and tracks requests in our ITSM, keeping the workflow compliant and traceable. It runs on Azure AI Agents with managed identities, private networking, and full telemetry via Application Insights, so itâ€™s production-ready and measurable from day one. The result is faster decisions without sacrificing governance, fewer ad-hoc BI/engineering tickets, and clear accountability over how data is used.
